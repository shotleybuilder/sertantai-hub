**Started**: 2026-02-19
**Issue**: https://github.com/shotleybuilder/sertantai-hub/issues/2
**Status**: Complete

## Todo
- [x] Design landing page sections (hero, services, mission, account, footer)
- [x] Implement landing page replacing dev test page
- [x] Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- [x] Keep `/` behind auth guard (all access requires login)

- `a88296d` feat: build sertantai.com landing page with hero, services, mission sections (closes #2)

## Notes
- Reference: https://spongl.com (prototype of SertantAI platform)
- Landing page is behind auth guard — unauthenticated users see `/login`
- Services: Legal, Enforcement, Controls — all "In Development"

**Ended**: 2026-02-19
