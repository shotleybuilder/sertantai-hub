# Issue #14: Operationalise Organisation card on Dashboard

**Started**: 2026-02-27 09:35 UTC
**Issue**: https://github.com/shotleybuilder/sertantai-hub/issues/14

## Todo
- [x] Investigate current dashboard org card implementation
- [x] Add org API endpoint (proxy to auth or hub-native)
- [x] Create organisation settings page
- [x] Wire dashboard card to settings page
- [x] Display org name instead of truncated ID
- [x] Remove 'Coming Soon' badge

## Notes
- Auth service: new OrganizationController (GET/PATCH /api/organization)
- Auth service: org_name added to JWT claims
- Hub backend: proxy routes at /api/auth/organization
- Hub frontend: organization.ts API module, settings/organization page
- Auth store: organizationName field from JWT org_name claim
- Dashboard: org card now links to /settings/organization, shows org name
- All tests pass: auth 246, hub backend 94, hub frontend 46
