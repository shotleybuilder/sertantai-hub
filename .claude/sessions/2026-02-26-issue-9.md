# Issue #9: Law change notification subscriptions for free-tier users

**Started**: 2026-02-26
**Issue**: https://github.com/shotleybuilder/sertantai-hub/issues/9

## Todo
- [ ] Plan implementation phases and approach
- [ ] Create LawChangeSubscription Ash resource
- [ ] Create LawChangeEvent Ash resource
- [ ] Register resources in Api domain
- [ ] Generate and run migrations
- [ ] Add webhook endpoint (POST /api/webhooks/law-change)
- [ ] Implement subscription matching logic
- [ ] Add tier-based subscription limits
- [ ] Phase 1: Email delivery (Swoosh)
- [ ] Frontend: subscription management UI
- [ ] Tests for resources, matching, and webhook

## Notes
- Significant feature: webhook ingestion from sertantai-legal, subscription matching, notifications
- Multi-tenant: all resources need organization_id
- Phased delivery: email first, in-app later, webhooks for paid tiers
- Needs Oban for async job processing (digest batching)
