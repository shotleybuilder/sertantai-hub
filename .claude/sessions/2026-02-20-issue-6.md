# Issue #6: TOTP setup and management UI in user settings

**Started**: 2026-02-20
**Issue**: https://github.com/shotleybuilder/sertantai-hub/issues/6

## Todo
- [ ] Add backend proxy endpoints for TOTP (setup, enable, disable)
- [ ] Add TOTP proxy routes to router
- [ ] Add QR code rendering library to frontend
- [ ] Create settings/security page with TOTP section
- [ ] Implement setup wizard: QR display → verify code → done
- [ ] Implement disable flow with code confirmation
- [ ] Add proxy tests for TOTP endpoints
- [ ] Test end-to-end with sertantai-auth running

## Notes
- Auth endpoints: POST /api/totp/setup, /api/totp/enable, /api/totp/disable (all JWT-authed)
- Depends on sertantai-auth#9
- Setup returns {secret, uri, backup_codes}; render QR from uri
